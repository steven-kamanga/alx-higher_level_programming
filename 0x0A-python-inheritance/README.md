## Learning Objectives

### Inheritance

- Inheritance is a way to form new classes using classes that have already been defined. The newly formed classes are called derived classes, the classes that we derive from are called base classes. Important benefits of inheritance are code reuse and reduction of complexity of a program. The derived classes (descendants) override or extend the functionality of base classes (ancestors).

### Multiple Inheritance

- Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. The syntax for multiple inheritance in Python is similar to single inheritance. The only difference is that we use a comma-separated list of base classes in the definition of a derived class.
